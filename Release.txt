0.9.0.2: 

Initial release

_________________

0.9.0.2a: 

Updated documentation

_________________

0.9.0.2b: 

Updated documentation

_________________


0.9.0.3

1. Bug fix for situation where data from previous profile generation commands
could bias current profile genration, leading to an inaccurate profile. This
only impacted in situations when multiple profiles were generated from different
images in one session

2. Bug fix for Illuminant compensation on/off not always working

3. Updated documentation

_________________


0.9.0.4

1. Improved decompression/recompression code to reduce the prevalence of "rainbow
circles" when correcting large flat area of blue - e.g., the sky.


_________________


0.9.0.5

1. Workflow improvements - batch mode file correction and profile creation;
smart file name suggestions on save; CornerFix now separately tracks directories
for image and profile files, making it easier to work through files quickly

2. Image adjustments - Chroma and Luminance correction can now be adjusted
separately, and anti-aliasing strength is user controlable - an anti-aliasing 
strength of 0 is the same as 0.9.0.2 and 0.9.0.3, while a setting of 1 is the 
same as 0.9.0.4

3. Faster operation - optimized code means that devignetting is now 3-4 times 
faster

4. Enhanced documentation

Note that 0.9.0.5 is still an "8-bit" version, and so the concentric/rainbow 
circles artifacts can still emerge. A future version will support "16-bit" 
operation



_________________


0.9.0.6

1. More workflow improvements - options are now sticky between sessions

2. DNG file data - Both the "Software" tag and the XMP "CreatorTool" tag
are updated to show CornerFix's version number 

3. Lens profiles also show the CornerFix version number


_________________


0.9.1.0

1. "16-bit" operation. Note this is incompatible with Phase One Capture. C1 
users should set the "Enable Level Compression" option.

2. Minor fixes to the user interface
